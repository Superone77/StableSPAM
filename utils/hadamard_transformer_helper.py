def naive_hadamard_transform_with_scale(x, scale=1.0):
    """
    Performs a Hadamard transform on the input tensor with optional scaling.
    
    The Hadamard transform is a linear, orthogonal transform that decomposes a signal into 
    a set of Walsh functions. It's particularly useful in signal processing and data compression.
    
    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape (..., dim) where dim is the dimension to transform
        scale (float, optional): Scaling factor to apply after transformation. Defaults to 1.0.
    
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Transformed tensor of the same shape as input
        
    Note:
        - The input dimension must be padded to the next power of 2 if it's not already
        - The transform is applied along the last dimension
        - The output is scaled by the provided scale factor
